Mac OS X Kext Logging for Fun and Profit
========================================

Kernel extensions in Mac OS X ("kexts") log to the file /var/log/kernel.log
which is backed up somewhat infrequently. On my machine, I have backed up logs
dating from 6 months ago at the latest. Since my machine usage is probably very
anti-correlated with my sleeping, I decided to use kext logging to plot my
sleep schedule as a function of time.

This is sort of a response to
<http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/>
but using my own machine's tools and data, without relying on external APIs for
data gathering (e.g., email services), analysis, and visualization.

Mac OS X Kext Logging for Fun and Profit
========================================

Kernel extensions in Mac OS X ("kexts") log to the file /var/log/kernel.log
which is backed up somewhat infrequently. On my machine, I have backed up logs
dating from 6 months ago at the latest. Since my machine usage is probably very
anti-correlated with my sleeping, I decided to use kext logging to plot my
sleep schedule as a function of time.
